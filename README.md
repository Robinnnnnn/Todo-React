- This app uses local storage in order to store some data like groups and task items. After use of the app, please clear your local storage.
  - Right Click the browser, click inspect, click application, click local storage, then hit the circle with a line through it to clear it. EZ-PZ.
- I will continue to update the app over time for fun.
